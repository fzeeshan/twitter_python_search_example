# Simple twitter search example using REST API (python)
### twitter search client with gender and location guessing
### Since twitter firehose is no longer free, this is your best option to search for tweets, to do product or marketing research.
### In addition to sentiment analysis, I have also included gender and location guessing, which might be needed to figure out a response to certain product or service.
## Installation
### use pip or easy_install to intall all the requirements.
### * pip install TwitterSearch
### * pip install gender-detector
### * pip install geopy
### * pip install -U textblob
### * python -m textblob.download_corpora
### This is just a sample code, please feel free to make changes according to your needs, this is just a sample of what you are able to do, some of the use cases might include, doing a search for user sentiment and, figuring out their responses by polarity, location and gender. In addition you may need to store your tweets into Hadoop HDFS or other types of storage, I have tested this approach with 
<h4> Apache Gedoe/Gemfire </h4>
<h4> HDFS </h4> 
<h4> Redis </h4> 
<h4> File System </h4> 
<h4> Elasticsearch. </h4>

### I am sure this could easily be changed to work with any NoSQL or other database/sink.
